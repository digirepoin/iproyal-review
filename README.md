## IPRoyal Features  

### 1. Rotating Residential Proxies  
IPRoyal’s rotating residential proxies assign a new IP address for each request or session, minimizing the risk of detection and blocking. With over 5 million IPs across 195+ countries, users enjoy seamless access to geo-restricted content and comprehensive web scraping capabilities. These proxies are ideal for large-scale data extraction, price monitoring, and bypassing restrictive firewalls without compromising anonymity.

### 2. Sticky Sessions  
For tasks requiring session persistence—such as maintaining login states on websites—IPRoyal offers sticky sessions. You can hold the same residential IP for a customizable duration (up to 30 minutes), ensuring continuity for automation workflows, account management, and transactional testing while still leveraging residential IP advantages.

### 3. Geo-Targeting & Country-Level Filtering  
IPRoyal enables precise geo-targeting by allowing users to specify country, region, or city for their proxy endpoints. This feature is invaluable for market research and ad verification, ensuring that your requests originate from the exact location you need. Real-time filtering also supports ISP and ASN selection for even finer control.

### 4. Datacenter & Mobile Proxies  
Beyond residential IPs, IPRoyal provides high-speed datacenter proxies and mobile proxies sourced from real 4G/5G devices. Datacenter proxies deliver ultra-low latency—perfect for performance testing—while mobile proxies simulate genuine mobile traffic, aiding in social media management and mobile app testing.

### 5. API & SDK Integrations  
IPRoyal’s RESTful API allows full programmatic control of proxy sessions, usage statistics, and billing information. Official SDKs for Python, Node.js, and cURL simplify integration into existing scraping or automation frameworks. Built-in usage monitoring and rate-limit handling ensure efficient resource management and cost control.

### 6. IP Whitelisting & Access Control  
Enhance security by whitelisting specific IP addresses or CIDR blocks that are permitted to access your proxy endpoints. This access control mechanism prevents unauthorized usage and safeguards your account against malicious actors, ensuring that only trusted servers or workstations can utilize your proxy resources.

### 7. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard  
IPRoyal’s intuitive dashboard offers real-time insights into bandwidth consumption, request success rates, and session metrics. Customizable alerts notify you when usage thresholds are reached or when session errors exceed a set percentage—helping you optimize proxy allocation and detect issues proactively.
